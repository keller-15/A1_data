                     number of days the moon actually appears in the sky, since it is invisible for two days
                     at new moon when it was thought to be in the underworld. In this tradition, Osiris
                                                                                                   13
                     and the moon were also associated with the rise and retreat of the Rood            (FIG. 2-4B).

                        The earliest sky-watchers knew that in most years there were approximately twelve


1                    lunar months from one Rood to the next. They divided the twelve months into the
                     three seasons defined by the Rood and named the months for important feasts. Because
                     they referred both to the moon and to the seasonal year, their religious calendar was
                     not a lunar calendar, strictly speaking, but a lunisolar calendar. They also found that
                     its twelve-month scheme would regularly lag behind the inundation, and every few
                     years they would have to appeal to the pharaoh to insert an intercalary month into
                     the usual calendar to make the elaborate scheme right again.
10   fo ur teen th      To fix this endemic problem, sky-watchers and civil authorities created a new civil
V·
                     calendar to amend the peculiarities of the religious calendar, consisting of 360 days
                     organized into twelve months of exactly 30 days each. Five extra festival days were
                     added to bring the year to 365 days. The months were still grouped into three blocks
                     of four months each and numbered and named accordingly. This civil calendar was
                     already well established in the Old Kingdom period. Every pharaoh solemnly promised
                     not to amend the civil calendar as part of his coronation vows, so the system became
                     set in stone and persisted unchanged for at least two and a half millennia.
                        The length of the sidereal (i.e., associated with the stars) year is approximately 365.256
                     days rather than an even 365. Thus, every four years the civil calendar slipped by one
                     day. After one century, the civil New Year was around twenty-five days later than the
                     heliacal rise of Sirius and the beginning of the Rood. After one millennium, it was
                     250 days later. (It would take 1,461 years for the civil calendar to return to approximate
                     agreement with the original starting point without intervention) Of course, because
                     of the precession of the equinoxes, the date of the heliacal rise of Sirius itself had also
te mountains         changed enough to be out of sync with the beginning of the Rood. So many modern
Lrge amounts         scholars argue that the inception date of the civil calendar may be inferred from the
g was still so       regular cycle of the calendar itself and from dates when the heliacal rise of Sirius
Lr. Thus, New        coincided with the beginning of the Rood, but that issue is still a subject of debate.
>f the annual           The civil and temple authorities were aware that their calendar slipped against the
                     seasons, but they never made adjustments. They still maintained and corrected the
; of the moon,       lunar religious calendar for the sake of stability, and pragmatically decided to observe
e longer Row         religious feasts both on their civil dates and their lunisolar dates. They recognized
is associated        how far apart the civil and lunisolar events were and even commented on it. Essen-
es-fourteen          tially they elected to ignore the discrepancies that would challenge and exercise the

                                        Having agreed on a solution for the month and the year, the Egyptian sky-watchers
                                        still had to solve the problem of determining the time of day-important for know-
                                        ing when to conduct their daily rituals. The sky-watchers developed a set of methods
                                        adapted to daytime and another for the night. During the day they watched the                     ,2

                                        horizon.
                                           During the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom, the sky-watchers cataloged all the
                                        stars in a band parallel to and just to the south of the ecliptic, the sun's apparent path

                                        over the course of a year. They divided the band of stars into thirty-six consecutive

                                        and roughly equal parts of about    IO   degrees of arc each. They called the units bakiu.

                                                      Astronomy and physics were regarded as two separate disciplines from classical antiq-
                                                      uity until the development of early modern natural philosophy, due in great part to
                                                      Aristotle's resistance to Plato's emphasis on the usefulness of mathematics in studying
                                                      astronomy and the natural world. Aristotle generally maintained that geometry had
                                                      no applicable role in physics because perfect triangles and circles did not occur in
                                                      nature. Mathematics treated the realm of the perfect, the realm of unchanging ideas,
                                                      while physics was entirely concerned with change and alteration. Instead, Aristotle
                                                      used logic and qualitative arguments to develop a description of the structure of the
                                                      cosmos, which encompassed all operations and processes in both the celestial and ter-
                                                      restrial spheres within physics. If geometry had any place in astronomy, it was only
                                                      in the computation of mathematical-like mechanics.
